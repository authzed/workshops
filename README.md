## AuthZed Workshops

Here's the hub for all self-guided AuthZed workshops.  

#### 1. Secure Your RAG Pipelines With Fine Grained Authorization
This workshop gives you hands-on knowledge on using SpiceDB to safeguard sensitive data in your RAG pipelines. There are different branches for this workshop:

- (recommended) Using the OpenAI API, Pinecone, a local Jupyter Notebook instance and SpiceDB. [Link](https://github.com/authzed/workshops/tree/main/secure-rag-pipelines)
- Using the Deepseek R1 LLM (via OpenRouter), Pinecone, OpenAI Embeddings, a local Jupyter Notebook instance and SpiceDB. [Link](https://github.com/authzed/workshops/tree/deepseek/secure-rag-pipelines)

#### 2. Update A Web View Based on Permissions
This workshop will illustrate how you can update a view based on what permissions the user has. The workshop uses a NextJS template by Vercel for an admin dashboard, written in TypeScript. [Link](https://github.com/authzed/workshops/tree/main/update-views-authorization)

#### 3. Prevent AI Agents from Accessing Unauthorization Data
This workshop shows how to build a secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline where AI Agents can only access documents they are authorized for. Authorization decisions are enforced by SpiceDB in a post-filter approach. [Link](https://github.com/authzed/workshops/tree/main/ai-agent-authorization)
