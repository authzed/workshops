# From Zero to Permissions System in 10 Minutes using AuthZed MCP Servers

This workshop teaches you how to build and reason about authorization systems using **AuthZed** and **SpiceDB**, powered by **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers.

It's important to note **AI can’t secure AI** as probabilistic models hallucinate, misinterpret, and guess. Authorization must be deterministic. But with these two MCP servers, the AI isn’t improvising your authorization logic - it’s using deterministic operations that you validate. Every schema write, every permission check, and every relationship update is explicit and inspectable.

You will learn to:

- Model permissions using SpiceDB schemas, and write relationships for test data.
- Use a local in-memory SpiceDB instance for rapid iteration, via the SpiceDB Dev MCP Server
- Export schemas and version them in Git
- Deploy your system to **AuthZed Cloud** for a managed, production-ready environment

The end result is a fully working permissions system running in the cloud.
