## Secure Your RAG Pipelines With Fine Grained Authorization

This workshop gives you hands-on knowledge on using SpiceDB to safeguard sensitive data in RAG pipelines. You will learn how to pre-filter a vector database queries with a list of authorized object IDs to improve security and efficiency. This workshop uses OpenAI, Pinecone, Langchain, Jupyter Notebook and SpiceDB

### Why is this important? 

Building enterprise-ready AI requires ensuring users can only augment prompts with data they're authorized to access. Fine-grained authorization in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be achieved with Relationship-based Access Control (ReBAC). ReBAC enables decisions based on relationships between objects, offering more precise control compared to traditional models like RBAC and ABAC.

This workshop gives you hands-on knowledge on using ReBAC to safeguard sensitive data in RAG pipelines using Pinecone, Langchain, OpenAI, and SpiceDB. 
The pre-requisites are: 


- Access to a SpiceDB instance and API key
- A Pinecone account and API key
- An OpenAI account and API key
- Jupyter Notebook and Python installed
