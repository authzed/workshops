# From Zero to Permissions System in Under 10 Minutes using AuthZed MCP Servers

> Status: Draft

This workshop teaches you how to build and reason about authorization systems using **AuthZed** and **SpiceDB**, powered by **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers.

You will learn to:

- Model permissions using **SpiceDB schemas**
- Use a **local in-memory SpiceDB instance** for rapid iteration
- Test and debug permissions with **MCP tools**
- Export schemas and **version them in Git**
- Deploy your system to **AuthZed Cloud** for a managed, production-ready environment

The end result is a fully working **permissions system** that supports real-world authorization patterns such as:

- Document sharing (owners / editors / viewers)
- Role inheritance
- Graph exploration
- Multi-tenant SaaS isolation
- Production deployment using AuthZed Cloud
